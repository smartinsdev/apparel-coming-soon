## My process

This project I separated into three blocks: the logo, the content, and the image. That way I can position the image below the logo when the device is mobile. In the desktop version I had some problems with the image, but in the end I think I got a good result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
